# Employee Tracker

## Description

This project is an app that allows you view and update a MySQL database using node. Using Inquirer, you can select which option you'd like, and then enter the followed prompts.

Throughout this project, I learned a lot about manipulating MySQL queries and pulling the data I needed.

## Installation

To install this project, please download the GitHub repository.

## Usage

After installing the GitHub repository, you will need to run a MySQL server and source the schema and seed files to use the database and insert data. Open the terminal and run with "Node index."
